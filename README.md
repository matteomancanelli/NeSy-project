Source code for paper submitted to the PMAI@ECAI2024 workshop.

## Dependencies

You can find a `Dockerfile` in this repository. You can either run the code on a Docker container or use the Dockerfile as a reference for the dependencies (mainly CUDA/torch and MONA) that need to be installed. You can also find an `environment.yml` file referring to a Conda virtual environment containing the Python dependencies. 

## Running the code

The file `run_all.py` is the script that runs all experiments shown in the paper. Once the script finishes executing, you can plot the results using the `plot.py` file.
